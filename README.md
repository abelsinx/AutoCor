# AutoCor
Simple C auto corrector that would receives a text from standard input, and put periods and capital letters where they are needed.

Notes:
-I provided a testfile so the program can be tested
-The program is in it's beta state. This means that it is wide open to colaboration and improvements.

Possible improvements:
-To this date, it does not read any other imput beside standard. Reading from files would be good too.
-It does not capitalize the personal pronoun letter 'I' if it is not placed right after a period.
